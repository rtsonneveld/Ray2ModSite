				<h1>Ray2Mod</h1>
				In Rayman 2 , the player can control the game's most famous protagonist, Rayman. As Rayman, the player can jump, run, jump across pits, and interact with objects and enemies in a variety of ways.
				Rayman 2 provides an extended variety of platforms to explore that includes the same jump mechanics seen in previous Rayman games, but with some new additions and twists such as:
				a rotating platform (which you can slide across ) for more precise jumping, a grapple that can be used to hold onto platforms that other players are able to ride, a "stick er" that allows for faster speedruns to be made, and more .
				<h2>New Elements</h2>
				Some new elements , such as an underwater area with more enemies that require a special ability , the use of special abilities to gain extra speed or health , are included as well, as is the ability to make a variety of jump moves to explore.
